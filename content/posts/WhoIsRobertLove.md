Short technology life history:

- From an early age I realized that I loved to learn and teach.
  - I learned basic in 5th Grade, and helped teach same class in 6th Grade
  - I learned Turbo Pascal in 10th Grade, and mentored others in 11th Grade.
- In 2002 I was invited to speak at Borland's Conference on Delphi and Interbase.
  - I continued to speak at these conferences for several years.
- From 2009-2019 I maintained a blog http://robstechcorner.blogspot.com/
  - In 2019 I left most of my Delphi work behind.

- Since then I have found myself using a variety of tools and languages.
  - As of Nov 11th, 2002 the languages I typically use are:
    - C#
    - TypeScript
    - Go
    - Python
    - Terraform
  - I live in the command line and such I typically use both Powershell and Bash
    - Powershell
    - Bash
  - I work as an Cloud Architect focusing primarily on AWS.
  - I have used many different CI/CD solutions, but recently settled on GitHub Actions.
  - My [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/rlove) goes into more detail.

On December 23, 2021 I was diagnosed with Parkinson's.  In July of 2022, I lost vision in my right eye.  I have a great desire to share my technology passions while I still can. So I decided to start a new blog.  I am very hopeful this can go for 10 years like the last one.

I am an active member of the [Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/)
